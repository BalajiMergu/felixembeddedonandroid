Now that we are able to launch Felix as a Java Application, 
we can use the debugging and profiling features of Eclipse. 
To debug bundles, create a new project for your bundle. Then 
develop your bundle normally. Afterward, compile / package 
your bundle to obtain the bundle Jar file. You can use Eclipse 
PDE, Maven, BND, iPOJO, etc... to package your bundle.

To debug, your code, first place a breakpoint inside your code. 
Launch Felix in debug mode. Then deploy your bundle Jar file. 
When the execution reaches the breakpoint, Eclipse opens the 
debug perspective. You can use all debugging features normally.
