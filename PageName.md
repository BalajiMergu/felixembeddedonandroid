Introduction into this project. Reading may help.

# Introduction #

I'll use this wiki to comment the projects hosted here.

Mainly I'll use this as a plattform linking the pages I used creating the projects.

All those tutorials and samples are partially outdated, so I changed some things, so that
they work with he following configuration

Android SDK 1.5r2

Felix 1.9.0 Snapshot

iPojo 1.3.0 Snapshot

Eclipse 3.4

ADT (Android Eclipse Plugin) 0.91

JVM 1.5 (put in 1.6 compatibility mode in Eclipse project settings!)

Mac OS X 10.5.7


# Details #
